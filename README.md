## Emotion Recognition

In this project, we demonstrate the creation of a Artificial intelligent system that can identify emotions from facial expressions. Three potential neural network topologies are developed, trained, and tested on a range of classification tasks before the top-performing network is further improved. The final model's applicability is demonstrated in a live video application that may instantly reflect the user's emotions.
